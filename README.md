# Getting Started
This documentation exists to help the Magnus Robotics (Stem Pit Crew) get started with their team repositories, learning how to program their robot(s), and chronicling their journey along the way.

## For students
Participating in a robot competition doesn't just mean building and driving your physical robot, but also learning how to program your robot. Even if you don't have a robot built yet, you can start testing your programming skills by visiting the following links:

-  [VEX Code Virtual Skills (VEX Robotics)](https://www.vexrobotics.com/vexcode/virtual-skills)
-  [Getting Started, VEX VR Skills (VEX Robotics)](https://www.vexrobotics.com/get-started/vex-vr-skills)
-  [VEX IQ Library](https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/categories/360002324792-IQ?sc=mechanical)

For your virtual skills key, please contact your mentor.

### Programming
To work on programming your robot, you will need to download [VEX Code](https://www.vexrobotics.com/vexcode/install/iq). To better understand how to program your "Byte" hero bot, check out [this article from VEX](https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/15768222047252).

To help you improve your programming skills, consider [programming an online robot](https://www.vexrobotics.com/vexcode/virtual-skills) to score points for your team. These challenges help you [learn more about the game](https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/15518491004692-Understanding-Robot-Features-in-VIQRC-Full-Volume-for-VEXcode-VR#robot-controls-xkNKZ) and also allow you to view sample programs. Each team has a Skills Key to access their online Virtual Skills robot.

## For mentors
Helping a team compete effectively means helping them problem solve, learn from their work, and iterate to a better solution. VEX provides a wealth of information [on their website](https://pd.vex.com) to help familarize yourself with the program and robot pieces. To access this information, you will need to create a login. Your professional development key will be supplied by Stem Pit Crew.

### Understanding the Engineering Process
Mentors should familarize themselves with [this year's robot competition (Full Volume)](https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/15957720967700-Getting-Started-with-VIQRC-23-24-Robot-Design-Full-Volume). 

### Building "Byte"
This year's "Hero bot" is called "Byte". To get started, here are two sets of build instructions:

1. [3D Build Instructions – Part 1](https://instructions.online/?id=4091-23-24%20hero%20part%201)
2. [3D Build Instructions – Part 2](https://instructions.online/?id=4091-23-24%20hero%20part%202)
